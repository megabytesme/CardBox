# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

Welcome to CardBox! This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our application. CardBox is designed to help users store all their cards in one place. We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information.

## Information Collection and Use

### No Data Collection

CardBox does not collect, store, or process any personal data from its users. The app functions solely as a tool to store cards locally on your device.

### Card Scanning

When you use CardBox to scan a card, we do not have access to the contents of the cards you scan, nor do we store any information about the cards.

## Third-party libraries

When you add a card to CardBox, and then view the card, (optionally) a web request will be made to OpenStreetMaps in order to find nearby locations with the name of the provided card, using their "OpenStreetMap Nominatim API". Only the coordinates of an area in which you are centred alongside the card name is sent. If you do not want this, simply disable the location permission in the app. CardBox does not collect any of your data, whatsoever. OpenStreetMap's "Nominatim API" Privacy Policy can be located here: https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/Privacy_Policy

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
